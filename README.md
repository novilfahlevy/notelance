# About this app
Notelance is a simple note app that supports offline mode, and of course, the synchronization with the remote database. I build this app, beside to practice my engineering skill, is to make a note app that fulfills my preferences about a simple note app that would replace Google Keep app as my primary notes app.

You can check the remote server source code here: https://github.com/novilfahlevy/notelance-remote-server-supabase

I know this app is simple and is not mind-blowing, but you can freely develop this on your own too.

# Upcoming features
I am planning to make the desktop version of Notelance, and both platforms (mobile and desktop) will support realtime multi-user editing like Google Docs.
